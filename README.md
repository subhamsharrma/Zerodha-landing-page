ðŸš€ Week 1 Project: Zerodha Homepage Clone (HTML + CSS)

Zerodha logo + header navigation (Signup, About, Products, Pricing, Supports)
Centered hero image from official Zerodha site
Clean and minimal typography section: main heading & subheading
Clickable "Sign up for free" button (currently links to Google for testing)
